S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O - Open/Closed Principle (ORP)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# Why we need SOLID or its benefits
- Better Testability
- Reduces coupling
- Removes Duplication
- Increases Readability
- Increases Extensibility

#SRP says :
- A class/method should have one reason to change
- A class/method should have only one responsibility
- A class/method should be related to a single purpose
